# Simple jQuery Image Preloader

[Simple jQuery Image Preloader](https://github.com/stffndtz/simple-jquery-image-preloader) is a simple script for preloading images on any website. It's only 1kb, finds the images automatically and fires a "preloadFinished" Event when ready.

Furthermore adds a nice Splashloader. And there's nothing you have to do but add the script at the bottom of your page. 

#Usage

Simply include the script at the bottom of your <body>. Nothing more.

#Options
